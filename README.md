# UrNotes (Back End)

## Description:
This is the back end to a fairly simple notes application I made. I used Node, Express, and MongoDB. Users can make accounts, store their notes, and login to view their notes at anytime. The user is authenticated using JWT. Passwords are salted and hashed before being stored. All data coming into the server is sanitized. CRUD operations for folders and notes are implemented. REST API for HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
